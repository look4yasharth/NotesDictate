# Notes Dictate
This watchOS application that I built lets users dictate notes directly to their watch. The user can also browse through and read previous notes.

In this project, I learnt to show tables of data for the user to choose from and how to move between different screens of information. I also learnt how to convert userâ€™s voice into text so that it can be read.
